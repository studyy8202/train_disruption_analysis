# Train disruption analysis

# Project description

The other day, my train was delay and I had to wait for almost 30 minutes to get to the next train. This incident makes me wonder what causes train to delay. It is also interesting to see which train routes suffer the most disruptions and how long disruptions last.

This project helps me to hone my skills in data transformation, analysis and visualization. 

# Dataset

The dataset is from Rijden de Treinen. This website collects data from Dutch public transport and calculate metrics abour train. 

# Conclusion

Based on the 2023 train disruption dataset in the Netherlands, I have some interesting insights:
- Train defects typically cause disruptions of low or medium severity, lasting at most 60 minutes.
- Staffing issues, such as striking, tend to make disruptions last longer, but that issue often occurs on international routes (to Germany).
- A common route, such as Amsterdam-Rotterdam, is generally disrupted by train defects.
- Weekdays (Mondayâ€“Friday) experience more disruptions than weekends.
It is better if I can obtain a multi-year dataset so that I can conduct a year-by-year comparison of disruption causes and disruption duration. However, this analysis sheds light on the reasons behind a delayed or cancelled train in the Netherlands.
