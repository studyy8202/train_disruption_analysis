# Train disruption analysis

# Project description

The other day, my train was delay and I had to wait for almost 30 minutes to get to the next train. This incident makes me wonder what causes train to delay. It is also interesting to see which train routes suffer the most disruptions and how long disruptions last.

This project helps me to hone my skills in data transformation, analysis and visualization. 

# Dataset

The dataset is from Rijden de Treinen. This website collects data from Dutch public transport and calculate metrics abour train.
